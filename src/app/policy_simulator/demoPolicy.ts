export default `Proposal: Implement a 'Car-Free Sundays' initiative in Central London

Starting from next month, we propose to close major roads in Central London to private vehicles every Sunday from 6 AM to 6 PM. This policy aims to:

Reduce air pollution and carbon emissions
Promote walking, cycling, and use of public transportation
Create more public spaces for community events and activities
Boost local businesses by increasing foot traffic

Emergency vehicles, public transportation, and cyclists would still have access. The city will provide additional bus and tube services to accommodate increased demand.
To support this initiative, we'll also:

Set up temporary bike rental stations
Organize street markets and cultural events
Offer free public transportation on these Sundays for the first three months

We believe this policy will improve air quality, encourage healthier lifestyles, and foster a stronger sense of community in Central London.`;
